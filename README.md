# Pygame Raycaster with lighting

Here's a raycaster I built in pygame with some cool lighting

CONTROLS:
    w,a,s,d to move
    left and right arrow keys to pan
    up and down arrow keys to pan up and down
    esc to kill the process

Dependencies:
    - pygame
    - time 
    - math
    - sys

The size and structure of the map can be changed by modifying the map list and putting 1's in places where you want a wall
Inside the settings.py file you can modify the spawnpoint location, player speed, rotation speed and resolution

This project includes a basic game/objective mode which you can try out by uncommenting the lines in main.py
The assets directory is only necessary for the objective mode otherwise it can be removed

You can also play around with the lighting and get it to look more realistic 
feel free to use this code in your own game/project and drop a star

I probably wont update this project as there is nothing interesting left to add
