# Pygame Raycaster with lighting

**Here's a raycaster I built in pygame with some cool lighting**

CONTROLS:

    w,a,s,d to move
    left and right arrow keys to pan left and right
    up and down arrow keys to pan up and down
    esc to kill the process

Dependencies:

    - pygame
    - time 
    - math
    - sys

The size and structure of the map can be changed by modifying the map list and putting 1's in places where you want a wall. </br>
Inside the settings.py file you can modify the spawnpoint location, player speed, rotation speed and resolution.

This project includes a basic game/objective mode which you can try out by uncommenting the lines in main.py. </br>
The assets directory is only necessary for the objective mode otherwise it can be removed. </br>

You can also play around with the lighting and get it to look more realistic. </br>
feel free to use this code in your own game/project and drop a star. </br>

I probably wont update this project as there is nothing interesting left to add. </br>
